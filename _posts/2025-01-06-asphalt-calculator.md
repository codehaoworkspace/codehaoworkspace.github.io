Recently, while browsing construction and DIY forums, I noticed a common question popping up again and again: **“How do I accurately calculate the amount of asphalt needed?”** Whether it’s for paving a driveway or building a parking lot, people wanted a quick and reliable way to estimate the required tons of asphalt and the associated costs. Manual calculations, however, are not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. That’s when an idea struck me: **Why not create an online tool to solve this problem?**

So, I got to work! I decided to build an **Asphalt Calculator** that would allow users to simply input the length, width, and depth of their project area to get instant results for asphalt quantity and cost estimates. To make the development process more efficient, I tried a new approach: combining **VS Code + Cline + DeepSeek (an AI coding assistant)**.


## **1. Defining Requirements: AI Lends a Hand**
At the start of the project, I needed to clearly define the tool’s features and user requirements. This is where **DeepSeek** came in handy. By inputting keywords like “asphalt calculation needs” or “construction material estimation,” the AI helped me quickly identify the core user needs:
- Input length, width, and depth to calculate asphalt quantity (in tons).
- Estimate total costs based on current market prices.
- Provide a simple, user-friendly interface suitable for non-technical users.

With these clear requirements, I was able to sketch out a prototype in no time.

## **2. Coding the Solution: VS Code + CLI for Efficient Development**
Next came the coding phase. I used **VS Code** as my development environment, paired with command-line tools (CLI) to manage project dependencies and build processes. To speed up development, I once again turned to **DeepSeek** for AI-powered coding assistance:
- Generating the basic code structure.
- Debugging errors in the code.
- Optimizing algorithms to ensure accurate calculations.

With the help of AI, what could have taken days was completed in just one day.

## **3. Launching the Tool: Helping Others While Learning Myself**
After a few days of development and testing, my **Asphalt Calculator** was finally ready! You can check it out here: [https://asphalt-calculator.online/](https://asphalt-calculator.online/). This tool not only helps users quickly calculate asphalt quantities and costs but also gave me a chance to experience the efficiency and fun of AI-assisted programming.

## **4. Why You Need This Tool**
- **Accurate Calculations**: Just input a few numbers, and you’ll get precise asphalt quantity and cost estimates.
- **Free to Use**: No registration or payment required—just open the website and start using it.
- **For Everyone**: Whether you’re a homeowner, contractor, or engineer, this tool is designed to be easy to use.

## **5. What I Gained from This Project**
Through this project, I not only solved a real-world problem but also explored a new way of coding with **AI assistance**. From defining requirements to writing code, AI played a significant role in making the process smoother. If you’re interested in programming or have a similar idea, I highly recommend trying the **VS Code + CLI + DeepSeek** combo—it might just surprise you!

Finally, I’d like to invite you to try out my tool: [https://asphalt-calculator.online/](https://asphalt-calculator.online/). I hope it saves you time and makes your project planning easier!
